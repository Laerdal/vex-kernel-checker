## 3. Technical Paper Outline

### Title
"VEX Kernel Checker: Automated CVE Impact Analysis for Linux Kernel Configurations"

### Abstract (Example)
```
We present VEX Kernel Checker, an automated tool for analyzing CVE vulnerability
impact against specific Linux kernel configurations. The tool addresses the
critical gap between vulnerability disclosure and impact assessment by correlating
CVE data with kernel build configurations, patch analysis, and Makefile dependencies.

Our approach combines:
1. Automated patch extraction and analysis from NVD API data
2. Sophisticated Makefile parsing with recursive dependency resolution
3. Configuration option mapping with architecture-aware filtering
4. Performance optimization through multi-level caching

Evaluation on [X] CVEs across [Y] kernel configurations shows [Z]% accuracy
improvement over manual analysis, with [A]x performance improvement through
caching optimization.
```

### Key Technical Contributions
1. **Novel correlation methodology** between CVE patches and kernel configurations
2. **Advanced Makefile parsing** with variable expansion and recursive includes
3. **Performance optimization** through intelligent caching strategies
4. **Graceful fallback mechanisms** for incomplete data scenarios
