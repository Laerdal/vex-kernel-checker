# GitHub-First Patch Fetching Implementation

## Summary of Changes

The VEX Kernel Checker now prioritizes GitHub for patch fetching, which provides better reliability and API availability.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Modified `extract_patch_url()` Function**
- **Before**: Prioritized `git.kernel.org` and `github.com` equally
- **After**: Prioritizes GitHub URLs first, then kernel.org URLs
- **Benefit**: Better success rate due to GitHub's superior API reliability

### 2. **Enhanced `get_alternative_patch_urls()` Function** 
- **Before**: Mixed GitHub and kernel.org URLs in template list
- **After**: Separates GitHub and kernel.org templates, prioritizing GitHub first
- **Benefit**: Fallback URLs are tried in optimal order

### 3. **Improved `fetch_patch_content_with_github_priority()` Function**
- **Before**: Only tried GitHub API if original URL was from GitHub
- **After**: Always tries GitHub API first if commit ID can be extracted
- **Benefit**: Leverages GitHub API even when original URL is from kernel.org

### 4. **Enhanced Commit ID Extraction Patterns**
- **Added**: Support for `git.kernel.org/stable/c/COMMIT_ID` format
- **Added**: Support for `git.kernel.org/*/c/COMMIT_ID` format
- **Benefit**: Better commit ID extraction from various kernel.org URL formats

## New Patch Fetching Flow

1. **Primary URL Selection** (from NVD API response):
   - ✅ **GitHub URLs** (highest priority)
   - ✅ **kernel.org URLs** (second priority)  
   - ✅ **Other patch URLs** (fallback)

2. **Patch Content Fetching**:
   - ✅ **GitHub API** (try first if commit ID available)
   - ✅ **Direct HTTP** to selected URL
   - ✅ **Alternative URLs** (GitHub URLs tried first)
   - ✅ **WebDriver** (final fallback)

3. **Alternative URL Generation** (for commit ID `abc123`):
   ```
   1. [Original URL] (as provided)
   2. https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/abc123.patch
   3. https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/abc123.diff  
   4. https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/abc123
   5. https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/patch/?id=abc123
   6. https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/patch/?id=abc123
   ```

## Benefits

- ✅ **Higher Success Rate**: GitHub has better uptime and API availability
- ✅ **Faster Response**: GitHub APIs typically respond faster
- ✅ **Better Format Support**: GitHub provides multiple patch formats (.patch, .diff)
- ✅ **Improved Reliability**: Reduced dependency on kernel.org availability
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Still supports all existing URL formats

## Testing Results

- ✅ URL selection correctly prioritizes GitHub
- ✅ Alternative URL generation puts GitHub URLs first
- ✅ Commit ID extraction works for all kernel.org formats
- ✅ Patch fetching attempts GitHub API regardless of original URL source

The VEX Kernel Checker now provides more reliable patch fetching with GitHub-first priority while maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows.
